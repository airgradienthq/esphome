# AirGradient ESPHome Configurations

This version is based on [MallocArray ESP Home](https://github.com/MallocArray/airgradient_esphome) integration. Many thanks for suporting the community!

This repository contains changes so that the ESPHome firmware can be flashed on the monitors during our assembly process and also support of less devices. If you like to flash an existing AirGradient device, we recommend you use the original repository from [MallocArray ESP Home](https://github.com/MallocArray/airgradient_esphome) which also contains detailed descriptions.
