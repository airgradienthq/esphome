# AirGradient ESPHome Configurations

This version is based on [MallocArray ESP Home](https://github.com/MallocArray/airgradient_esphome) integration. Many thanks for supporting the community!

This repository contains changes so that the ESPHome firmware can be flashed on the monitors during our assembly process and supports only the AirGradient ONE (I-9PSL) and AirGradient Open Air (O-1PST) models. If you like to flash an existing or different AirGradient device, we recommend you use the original repository from [MallocArray ESP Home](https://github.com/MallocArray/airgradient_esphome) which also contains detailed descriptions.
